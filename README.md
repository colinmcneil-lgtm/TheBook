# Embed

A hiring workspace for an embedded recruitment agency: one place to run inbound applicants, pipelines,
interviews and reporting for every company you work inside, with a login for each client's hiring team.

"Embed" is a working name. Your agency name is set at first sign-in and shown throughout.

## What it does

| Area | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Clients** | Each company you embed in has its own jobs, candidates, hiring-team logins, brand colour and engagement terms (retainer, fee per hire, or both). A switcher scopes the whole workspace to one client or all of them. |
| **Careers pages** | Every client gets a public, branded careers page at `/careers/<client>` listing open roles, each with an application form (résumé upload, custom screening questions, consent). Link to it from the client's website. Add `?src=linkedin`, `?src=job_board` or `?src=referral` to an apply link to track where applicants came from. |
| **Inbox** | Every new application across all clients lands in one review queue, oldest first. |
| **Pipeline** | A drag-and-drop board per job with stages you define. Ratings, notes (optionally agency-only), rejection reasons, withdrawals, offers. |
| **Shortlist hand-off** | Submit a candidate to the hiring team with your write-up. They approve (the candidate moves to the next interview stage) or decline with a reason, so you can calibrate. |
| **Interviews** | Schedule with a panel, download a calendar file, and collect a structured scorecard from each interviewer against the criteria set on the job. Outstanding scorecards are chased in the sidebar and dashboard. |
| **Email** | Templates with merge fields; every message is recorded on the candidate. Application confirmations, interview invitations and rejections can be sent automatically. |
| **Reports** | Funnel conversion, source effectiveness, weekly application volume, time to hire, open-role ageing and hires. Printable for client reviews. Your retainer and placement-fee revenue is shown to your agency only. |
| **Access** | Agency admins and recruiters see every client. Client users see only their own company, and never see your fees, internal brief or agency-only notes. |

## Run it

Requires Node.js 22.13 or newer.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run seed
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. `npm run seed` loads a demo agency with three fictional clients; skip it to start
empty, in which case the first visit asks you to create your owner account.

Demo sign-ins (password `demo1234` for all):

| Who | Email | Sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agency owner | `alex@harbourtalent.example` | Everything |
| Recruiter | `priya@harbourtalent.example` | All clients, no team admin |
| Client hiring manager | `maya@lumenhealth.example` | Lumen Health only |

Public careers page for the demo: http://localhost:3000/careers/lumen-health

To wipe the database and reload the demo: `npm run seed -- --reset`.

## Put it online

The app is a single Node process with a SQLite database file, so it runs on any host that offers a
persistent disk (Render, Railway, Fly.io, a small VPS).

```bash
docker build -t embed .
```

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v embed-data:/data embed
```

### Railway

1. Create a service from this GitHub repository. Railway builds it from the `Dockerfile`.
2. Attach a **Volume** to the service with the mount path `/data`. Without it, the database and résumés are wiped on every deploy.
3. Add a service variable `PORT` = `3000`, then generate a public domain for the service pointing at port 3000.
4. Open the domain. The first visit asks you to create your owner account.

The `Dockerfile` deliberately has no `VOLUME` instruction, because Railway rejects builds that contain one.

### Any host

- **Persistent storage is required.** The database and résumés live in `DATA_DIR` (`/data` in the container).
  Without a mounted volume they are lost on every redeploy. Back this folder up.
- **Serve it over HTTPS** (every host above does this for you) and point a domain at it, for example
  `hiring.youragency.com`. Careers pages then live at `hiring.youragency.com/careers/<client>`.
- **Connect email** by setting `SMTP_URL` and `MAIL_FROM` (see `.env.example`). Until you do, emails are
  saved on the candidate's record and clearly marked as not sent.

## How it is built

```
server/
  index.js   Express server; serves the API and the built front end
  api.js     All API routes: auth, careers pages, jobs, pipeline, interviews, reports
  db.js      SQLite schema and helpers (Node's built-in node:sqlite, no native modules)
  mail.js    Optional SMTP delivery; every email is logged either way
  seed.js    Demo data
src/
  App.jsx, state.jsx, lib.js, ui.jsx   App shell, data hooks, helpers, shared components
  components/                           Candidate profile, modals, forms, layout
  pages/                                One file per screen, plus the public careers pages
```

Security basics in place: salted scrypt password hashing, HTTP-only same-site session cookies, every
request checked against the signed-in user's client, rate limiting on sign-in and public applications,
résumé uploads restricted by type and size, and a honeypot field on application forms.

## Not built yet

- Calendar integration (Google or Microsoft) for live availability and automatic invites; today you get a calendar file to download.
- Self-service password reset by email; an agency user sets a new temporary password instead.
- AI-assisted screening or candidate summaries.
- Multi-posting to job boards, e-signature for offers, and headcount planning or onboarding checklists.
- Automated tests in the repository (the flows were verified end to end in a browser during development).
